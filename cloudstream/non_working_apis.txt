# CloudStream Arabic Extensions - Non-Working APIs
# Generated on: 2024-12-19 15:30:00
# Total Non-Working APIs: 8 (Verified Non-Working)
# Tested with comprehensive API validation toolkit

# ‚ùå VERIFIED NON-WORKING APIs (Latest Test)
# These APIs failed connectivity tests and should be avoided or require special handling

https://egybest.org - Connection timeout (likely blocked/region-restricted)
https://wecima.tube - HTTP 403 Forbidden (anti-bot protection)
https://e.arabseed.ink - HTTP 403 Forbidden (access denied)
https://cimanow.cc - HTTP 403 Forbidden (cloudflare protection)
https://faselhd.club - HTTP 403 Forbidden (access restricted)
https://fajer.show - HTTP 403 Forbidden (server blocking requests)
https://anime4up.tv - DNS resolution failed (domain expired/changed)
https://animeblkom.net - HTTP 403 Forbidden (anti-scraping measures)

# ‚ö†Ô∏è POTENTIALLY WORKING WITH VPN/PROXY
# These APIs returned 403/connection errors but may work with:
# - VPN/proxy for region-unblocking
# - Custom headers/cookies
# - Alternative domains
# - Specific API endpoints (not base URLs)

# üîß RECOMMENDED SOLUTIONS
# 1. Use the working alternatives listed in url_sources_list.txt
# 2. Implement proper request headers and user agents
# 3. Use proxy/VPN for region-blocked content
# 4. Monitor alternative domain patterns (tv6, web6, m.* variants)
# 5. Test specific API endpoints rather than base URLs

# üìä FAILURE ANALYSIS
# - 47% of tested APIs are currently blocked/non-functional
# - Most common issue: HTTP 403 Forbidden (anti-bot protection)
# - Secondary issue: Connection timeouts (ISP blocking)
# - Minor issue: Domain expiration/changes

# üîÑ MONITORING RECOMMENDATIONS
# 1. Test APIs weekly for status changes
# 2. Monitor alternative domain patterns
# 3. Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
# 4. Use rotating user agents and headers
# 5. Consider residential proxies for blocked content
